## My process

Once I had set up my HTML I started on the CSS for the mobile version styling each item pretty much in the order it appeared in the CSS. I have used rem measurements liberally throughout, but have no idea if this is best practice or not.

In fairness I had already had a go when I had a reasonably decent full size page set up and then realised that the mobile version was going to be a pain to reverse engineer from what I had done so I started over and planned things more carefully.

### Built with

- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first time attempting to recreate anything this detailed so I have a huge amount to learn. I definitely realise the merits of Mobile-first workflow after a first bodged attempt.

As mentioned above I've been trying to get to grips with rem units and am starting to get a feel for how those work.

I'm definitely starting to get more of a feel for html and css and starting to get that immense satisfaction of creating something for yourself which I have experienced in other languages.

Also I adore SCSS.

### Continued development

I'm really looking forward to any feedback I receive from my first project. Going to continue working through some more of these challenges and chipping away at my Udemy course for the time being.
